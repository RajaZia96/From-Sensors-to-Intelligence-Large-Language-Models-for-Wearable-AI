## 📖 About the Review

This repository accompanies the systematic literature review titled **"Large Language Models in Wearables: A Comprehensive Survey with Taxonomy."**  
The review investigates the integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in wearable technology (WT) and how these models enhance various aspects of wearable systems, including:

- ✅ Context-aware intelligence  
- ✅ Human activity recognition  
- ✅ Sensor data fusion  
- ✅ Privacy-preserving learning

## 📚 Overview

Wearable technology, powered by multimodal data from devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and smart glasses, offers rich opportunities for real-time and personalized computing. However, key challenges persist, including:

- Real-time processing  
- Energy efficiency  
- Model scalability  
- Data privacy  

This review explores how LLMs can help address these challenges through advanced multimodal learning, self-supervised techniques, and scalable model design.
